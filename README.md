## Why is this project of interest to you?

I have always been very passionate about personal finance. Usually I track
my finances using a spreadsheet, but while talking to my peers I have
realised that it is quite tedious for people to create a spreadsheet
and constantly update it. An app would make it much easier for
data entry and also to get insights from that data as to how
a person's finances have improved from a previous time frame.
